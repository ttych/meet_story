.Slicing Heuristics
* Product Owner prioritises features.
* PO slices feature into user stories.
* "If feature contains more than 4 stories, it is sliced into 2 or more features".
* In Sprint Planning, team creates acceptance tests for each user story.
* "If there is more than 1 acceptance test, story is sliced into 2 or more stories".

.Then
* Measure story cycle time, if longer than 3 days, flag for conversation.
* Measure feature cycle time, if longer than is acceptable, adapt the heuristics.
