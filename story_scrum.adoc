== And Scrum ...


=== on Story

* No prescription on Story
* Wording used: work, Product Backlog Item, Task


=== on Ready

> Product Backlog items that can be Done by the Scrum Team within one Sprint are
  deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire
  this degree of transparency after refining activities.


=== on Refinement

> Product Backlog refinement is the act of breaking down and further defining
  Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items.

> This is often done by decomposing Product Backlog items into smaller work
  items of one day or less. How this is done is at the sole discretion of the
  Developers.
