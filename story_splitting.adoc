== Splitting story


=== Why

* easier to understand
* helps to identifying waste
* provides faster feedback loop

[.notes]
--
* so less miss-understanding on what is included or not
* so remove not essential / irrelevant scenarios
* because small stories could be delivered sooner
--

=== How

* A user story is shippable and valuable to the customer.
* So when value will be delivered to the end-user ?
* Vertical split (end-user focus) vs. horizontal (tech. focus) split.

[.notes]
--
.waterfall vs. agile
* delivering value at the end, is waterfall approach.
* delivering value at each step, is agile approach.

* Limit to split is the task.
